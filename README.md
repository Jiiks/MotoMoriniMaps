### Overview of the mappings per model, from old to recent, thanks to Ebi!

#### For the Corsaro 140hp
#### Standard maps

##### 2006
> 2333MA45 (D)
> In stationary range, clearly deviating mapping, this map is mainly known for cutting off the engine.

##### 2006 - 2007:
> 333MOL1249 (UK)
> Updated stationary section..

##### 2008 the so-called E3 map
> 23ACMOR95C (D,NL)
> Frequently used map. Starting/stationary run is good, gasoline consumption, and running at the bottom sometimes problematic.

> 23ACMOL49C (UK)  
> 23ACMOL49D (UK)
> Maps look generally like the E3 map.
##### 2010 the so-called E10
> 23ACMORCORA (D,NL)
> Improved E3 map. Economical. Great touring map, but there can sometimes be irregularities at constant speed (due to lean tuning). Fans kick in at 98 degrees.

#### Race Mappings (Lambda off):
> 23ACMOLK22C
> 23ACMOLK22D
> 23ACMOLK22D
> Maps clearly differ from the E3/E10 map. The 22D is the most current. High fuel consumption, finely tuned. Intended for open exhaust systems, clearly too rich for standard systems (EC approved). Fans activate at 98 degrees.

> 23ECMOLCORB (F)
> 23ECMOLCORC (NL,B,F)
> Current map, drives very well, consumption acceptable. Good for both open and closed systems. Fans kick in at 98 degrees.

#### Mappings 120hp models

#### Sport & Scrambler

> 23EDMORSPTC (F)(D)
> strongly resembles 23ECMOLSPTA (granpasso).

> 2337MOL95
> 2009 120HP Map

> 23ECMOLSPTA
> Without lambda regulation. Seems to work well on Sport & Scrambler.

#### Granpasso

> 23ACMORSPTA
> Granpasso standard map since 2008

> 23ECCLGPSMB
> 23ECCLGPSMC

#### Avio

> 23ACMORCAVG
> Corsaro Avio 2009 map. Differs significantly from all other maps in the stationary range.
